# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using Neural Network

This assignment demonstrates an image classification task on the CIFAR-10 dataset using a simple Neural Network implemented with TensorFlow/Keras.

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (version >= 2.x)
- Matplotlib
- Numpy

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pyritez3/DL-Simple-NN.git
   
   cd DL-Simple-NN

2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy
## Results
The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset for 100 epochs. The training and test accuracy and loss graphs are shown in the "MODEL ACCURACY" and "MODEL LOSS" plots.
